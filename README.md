# Block-Breaker
This is a Arkanoid clone I created following the second lesson of the Udemy course: Learn to Code by Making Games - Complete C# Unity Developer

### Instructions

1. Click on the designated link:  https://wholetpaulin.github.io/Block-Breaker/   (Wait for game to load up)

2. Left click the mouse to launch the ball.

3. The paddle follows your mouse pointer.  Try to keep the ball up long enough to destroy all the blocks!
